# OpsVox

A ClojureScript plugin for hubot (http://www.github.com/github/hubot) for doing DevOps work/monitoring via group chat

## Usage

OpsVox must be compiled to Javascript, then included in your hubot configuration.  As I do not currently know how to do this, I can't very well give you directions.
